# Module 10 Project: Jest Another RPG

## Description
As an introduction to Object Oriented Programming, this week we created a command-line role-playing game in which the user battles against a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. The game creates new objects using JavaScript constructor functions. We also implemented basic code tests using the Jest framework.  

## Overview of Concepts Learned
* How to integrate constructor functions into applications  
* How to build entire applications using OOP  
* Separating data and functionality into distinct constructor functions that can be composed together  
* Verifying that code works as intended through automated tests using the Jest framework  
* How to build applications using test-driven development  
* Writing tests before implementing functionality  
* Using modern ES6 class syntax to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance  
* Creating more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm
